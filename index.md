Fokal helps you find images you'll love and get your own images seen.

We use cutting edge machine intelligence in order to make sure your best images rise to the top and help you find the images that you're looking for.

<h2 class="f4 f2-m">For Photographers</h2>
  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">


Fokal is a place for people to find your images and use them. We're frusterated by the hundreds of good photos sitting in your archives that only friends and family have seen. With Fokal you can either give your photos away for free and have creatives give attribution for the image, or charge 99&cent; for unrestricted use without attribution.


  </p>
<h2 class="f4 f2-m">For Creatives</h2>
  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
For creatives, Fokal is about finding high quality, high resolution photos that you can use in any of your projects. Our balance between machine curation and human tagging, as well as an emphasis on metadata means you can find the photo you're looking for. Fokal handles queries complex like <em>cafes in paris</em> or <em>london skyline</em> as you would expect. The goal of all this is to help you find images you'll love.
