  Fokal is shutting down. I've learned a lot building it but don't have the time or the motivation to spend on improving the site. I'll be exploring other ideas and spending less time jamming away on the laptop outside work. Thanks for checking out Fokal and uploading your images. It's been fun.

<h2 class="f4 f2-m">Your Data</h2>
  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">

I'll keep the images living at images.fok.al up and running although they'll load more slowly than before. The API will shut down 11/3/18. If you need any specific files or want to download all your data you can find my info on my website: <a href="https://devinmcgloin.com">devinmcgloin.com</a>.
